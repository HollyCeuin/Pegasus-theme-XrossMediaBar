# XrossMediaBar with personal edits, listed below

New things: video background support with an option to enable or disable it, a toggle for 12/24h clock, and a language toggle to switch between favorite/favourite! I could also translate to more languages. This language option requires a restart after setting it, because I'm not that clever.

I've edited the favorite text to say favourite (nitpick I know), removed the year from the date to better match the PSP, added a PSP-accurate battery indicator and added the sfx to more things. 

This may not work on anything not on a 1920x1080 screen - I made these edits specifically for my AYN Odin Pro, it should work on both that and the base model, maybe even the Lite, but ymmv.

Massive thanks to Lx-Dm, I'd been waiting for an XMB theme for a while but didn't have the knowledge to make it, only to do these tweaks.
