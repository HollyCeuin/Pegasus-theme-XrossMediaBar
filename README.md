# XrossMediaBar with personal edits, listed below
I've edited the favorite text to say favourite (nitpick I know), removed the year from the date to better match the PSP, added a PSP-accurate battery indicator and added the sfx to more things. 

This may not work on anything not on a 1920x1080 screen - I made these edits specifically for my AYN Odin Pro, it should work on both that and the base model, maybe even the Lite, but ymmv.
